## Python introduction

Learning Python

Python is a very popular programming language

it is used for 
-web development
-software development
-mathematics
-system scripting

python can be used on a server to create web applications, alongside software to create workflows, it can also connect to database systems and read/modify files as well as to perform complex mathematics, handling big data and rapid prototyping or production-ready software development.

python syntax was designed for readability and has some similarities with the English language.

Python uses new lines to complete a command where other programming languages use semicolons or parentheses.

Python relies on Indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other languages use curly-brackets for this purpose.

Python does not need a compiler it is an interpreted language you just need the program that runs .py files which you install yourself.

It is also a good idea to keep up to date with the latest python versions.
